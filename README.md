# Experimental go client for commercetools REST API

As per header. No actual client functionality.
Currently stubbing out types for marshaling/unmarshaling JSON responses

Todo:

1. Set up client object that allows saving of OAuth2 token and client authentication flow
2. Implement interaction with tax and product endpoints
